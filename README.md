# PSO-RL
This implementation is built on top of [hardmaru's](https://github.com/hardmaru) [estool repo](https://github.com/hardmaru/estool). It includes an implementation of PSO for comparison to other black-box algorithms.

To-do: 
* Add PSO
* Get requirements right. Maybe update them. 
* Build framework for comparisons.
